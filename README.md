# BHSAD L5 Webspace, Hugo template for Netlify CMS with Netlify Identity

BHSAD Webspace template built with [Victor Hugo](https://github.com/netlify/victor-hugo) and [Netlify CMS](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms), designed and developed by [Darin Dimitroff](http://www.darindimitroff.com/), [spacefarm.digital](https://www.spacefarm.digital).

It contains 3 pages: 2 static (Index and Contact pages) and 1 dynamic (Post page).

## Getting started

Use the deploy button to get your own copy of the repository. 

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/danil-vladimirov/bhsad-webspace-hugo-netlify-cms&stack=cms)

This will setup everything needed for running the CMS:

* A new repository in your GitHub account with the code
* Full Continuous Deployment to Netlify's global CDN network
* Control users and access with Netlify Identity
* Manage content with Netlify CMS

Once the initial build finishes, you can invite yourself as a user. Go to the Identity tab in your new site, click "Invite" and send yourself an invite.

Now you're all set, and you can start editing content!
